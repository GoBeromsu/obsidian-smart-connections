## patch `v3.0.3`

- Added safe model-switch mode so results are constrained to the active embedding model.
- Introduced per-model embedding metadata (`embedding_meta`) for freshness checks.
- Treats legacy cache entries without per-model metadata as stale once (safe-first behavior).
- Updates embedding pipeline to write per-model metadata while keeping `last_embed` for compatibility.
- Emits `smart-connections:model-switched` and refreshes Connections/Lookup views to avoid stale mixed-model results.
- Adds search-layer stale guards and regression tests for model-switch safety.
