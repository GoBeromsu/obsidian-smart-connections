## patch `v3.0.2`

- Restored the richer Embedding Status UX in settings with clearer run-state chips and compact stat cards.
- Kept styling minimal and theme-aware using Obsidian color tokens so dark/light theme changes stay consistent.
- Retained embedding controls (`Stop`, `Resume`, `Re-embed stale`) and progress behavior.
- Includes centralized notice management improvements (mute/unmute, reuse, settings controls) and connections-view session visibility fixes from the current build line.
